R Client for the [data.govt.nz](https://www.data.govt.nz/use-data/using-data-govt-nz-apis/) web service. 

The package focuses on retrieving metadata, and datasets from the data.govt service, rather than on updating, creating, deletion operations.

The data.govt.nz web service is built on the apache-solr platform.

Detailed documentation on the metadata service endpoints are avaliable on [CKAN](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.7/api/index.html)

Documentation and guidelines for the datastore service is detailed at [CKAN Datastore](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.7/maintaining/datastore.html#the-datastore-api)
